#Grand Research Question: What does the consumption of each food category in each country look like?


**Get Data**
```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)

tuesdata <- tt_load('2020-02-18')
head(tuesdata)

fc <- tuesdata$food_consumption
head(fc)


```

**Understand Data**
```{r}
nrow(fc)
head(fc)
str(fc)
dim(fc)
tail(fc)

```

**Understand Variables Individually**

food_category is a categorical variable so use a bar graph to visualize
consumption is quantitative variable, could use histogram, density, or boxplot to visualize
co2_emmission is  quantitative variable, could use histogram, density, or boxplot to visualize
country is categorical variable so could use a bar graph to visualize
