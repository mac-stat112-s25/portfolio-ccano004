title: "Bivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

# What are the units of observation?
head(weather)
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "3 Australian cities are labeled"

ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + theme_classic() + 
  labs( x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)", title = "Density plot of 3pm temperature in Australian cities." , color = "City")
