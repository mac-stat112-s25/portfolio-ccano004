title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

# What are the units of observation?
head(weather)
```


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "This is a univariate density plot of 3pm temperature in Australian cities."

ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm)) +
      geom_density(fill = "brown") + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)", title = "Density plot of 3pm temperature in Austrailian cities" )

```
