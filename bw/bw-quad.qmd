title: "Quadvariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.




```{r}

library(tidyverse)

#Australian weather data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) 
head(weather)

```


```{r fig.cap = "Plot of 3pm temp vs 9am temperatures in 3 Austrailian cities with rainfall data.", fig.alt = "Plot of 3pm temp vs 9am temperatures in 3 Austrailian cities with rainfall data."}


ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, y = temp9am, color = raintoday)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap( ~ location) +
  labs(y = "9am temperature (Celsius)", x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)", color = "Rain") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "blue", "grey"))
