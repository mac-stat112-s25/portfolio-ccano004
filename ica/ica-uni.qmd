```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
head(hikes)

# Load the package
library(tidyverse)

# Use the ggplot function
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))

# This counted the number of hikes in each rating category, instead of the previous blank bar graph
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()

# This changed the names of the labels of the x-axis and y-axis
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")

# fill changed the color of the bar graph

  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")

# color = outline color of bars
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +

# changed the background of the bargraph

#Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart of Elevation

# Exercise 9: Building Histograms
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +

# outline of the bars is now white to easier distinguish
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 

# color of bars is blue with white outline

# changed axis labels
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +

# changed with of bars to include chunks of 1000 feet in elevation per bar
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
